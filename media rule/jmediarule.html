<p id="para">Uppalapati Venkata Suryanarayana Prabhas Raju (born 23 October 1979), known mononymously as Prabhas ([pɾabʱaːs]), is an Indian actor who predominantly works in Telugu cinema. One of the highest-paid actors in Indian cinema,[4] Prabhas has featured in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list three times since 2015 based on his income and popularity.[5][6][7] He has received seven Filmfare Awards South nominations and is a recipient of a Nandi Award and a SIIMA Award.

    Prabhas made his acting debut with the 2002 Telugu drama Eeswar, and later attained his breakthrough with the action romance Varsham (2004). His notable works include Chatrapathi (2005), Bujjigadu (2008), Billa (2009), Darling (2010), Mr. Perfect (2011), and Mirchi (2013). He won the Nandi Award for Best Actor for his performance in the lattermost.[8][9] In 2015, Prabhas starred in the title role in S. S. Rajamouli's epic action drama Baahubali: The Beginning, which is the fourth-highest-grossing Indian film to date. He later reprised his role in its sequel, Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017), which became the first Indian film ever to gross over ₹1,000 crore (US$155 million) in all languages in just ten days, and is the second-highest-grossing Indian film to date.
    
    In addition to acting in films, Prabhas is also the brand ambassador for the Mahindra TUV300. He is the first Telugu actor to receive a wax sculpture at Madame Tussaud's wax museum.</p>

    <p>in 2012, Prabhas starred in Rebel, an action film directed by Raghava Lawrence. Sashidhar from The Times of India stated, "The film belongs to hard-core Prabhas fans as the movie is stylish and visually rich but not much in content".[23] Purnima Ranawat from NDTV said, "Rebel serves up fare for the mass audience. The film will be definitely liked by Prabhas' fans. Watch it for the dancing talent of Tamannaah and action skills of Prabhas."[24] Radhika Rajamani from Rediff.com gave the movie 1.5 stars out of five and said, "Working with hardly any storyline, director Raghava Lawrence had made a film that is arduous to watch... Rebel is a movie for the masses and certainly not for the discerning audience."[25] He also rendered voice for a short cameo for the film Denikaina Ready (2012).[26]

        In 2013, Prabhas starred in Mirchi. Jeevi of Idlebrain.com gave a rating of 3.25 out of 5, commenting that "First half of Mirchi is decent. Flashback episodes which occupies the lion's share of the second half is good. Climax could have been better. The plus points of the film are Prabhas, music and all-round orientation. On a whole, Mirchi has all the ingredients of a commercial potboiler".[27] Mahesh S Koneru gave his verdict that "At the box office, the film will turn in a good commercial performance", giving the film a score of 3.25/5.[28] Way2movies also gave a rating of 3.25/5, giving the verdict that "Prabhas rocks the show in this decent yet formulaic commercial entertainer".[29] SuperGoodMovies gave the film 3 stars in a scale of 5, reviewing that "Go and Watch Mirchi, It entertains both class and mass. It is a worth watch."[30] His performance in the film earned him his fifth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu. He then made his Hindi cinema debut in 2014 in the item number "Punjabi Mast" from the film Action Jackson.</p>
