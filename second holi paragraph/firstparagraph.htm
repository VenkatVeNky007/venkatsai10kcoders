<h2><u>Cultural significance</u></h2>
<p>The Holi festival has a cultural significance among various Hindu traditions of the Indian subcontinent. It is the festive day to end and rid oneself of past errors, to end conflicts by meeting others, a day to forget and forgive. People pay or forgive debts, as well as deal anew with those in their lives. Holi also marks the start of spring, an occasion for people to enjoy the changing seasons and make new friends.</p>
<p>In Mughal India, Holi was celebrated with such exuberance that people of all castes could throw colour on the Emperor.[44] According to Sharma (2017), "there are several paintings of Mughal emperors celebrating Holi".[45] Grand celebrations of Holi were held at the Lal Qila, where the festival was also known as Eid-e-gulaabi or Aab-e-Pashi.[44] Mehfils were held throughout the walled city of Delhi with aristocrats and traders alike participating.[44] This changed during the rule of Emperor Aurangzeb. He banned the public celebration of Holi using a Farman issue in November 1665.[46] However, the celebration were later restarted after the death of Emperor Aurangzeb. Bahadur Shah Zafar himself wrote a song for the festival, while poets such as Amir Khusrau, Ibrahim Raskhan, Nazeer Akbarabadi and Mehjoor Lakhnavi relished it in their writings.</p><hr>
