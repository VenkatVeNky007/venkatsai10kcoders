            <P>Everything I know I learned from dogs.</P>
            <p>Dogs do speak, but only to those who know how to listen.</p>
            <p>Dogs’ lives are too short. Their only fault, really.</p>
            <p>Dogs are not our whole life, but they make our lives whole.</p>
            <p>Some of my best leading men have been dogs and horses.</p>
            <p>The better I get to know men, the more I find myself loving dogs.</p>
            <p>Dogs never bite me. Just Humans</p>
            <p>Anybody who doesn’t know what soap tastes like never washed a dog.</p>
            <p>A dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than he loves himself.</p>
            <p>Such short little lives our pets have to spend with us, and they spend most of it waiting for us to come home each day.</p>
            <p>If there are no dogs in Heaven, then when I die I want to go where they went.</p>
            <p>There is no faith which has never yet been broken, except that of a truly faithful dog</p>
